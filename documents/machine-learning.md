# Machine Learning Pipeline

## Overview

The machine learning pipeline is designed for car price prediction using historical car data. It implements a complete ML lifecycle from data preprocessing to model deployment and monitoring.

## Data Pipeline

### Data Collection

- Historical car sales data
- Features:
  - Make and model
  - Year of manufacture
  - Mileage
  - Fuel type
  - Transmission
  - Engine size
  - Price (target variable)

### Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Missing value handling
   - Outlier detection
   - Data type conversion
   - Feature validation

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - Feature scaling
   - Age calculation from year
   - Interaction features
   - Feature selection

## Model Development

### Model Architecture

- Base Model: Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Alternative Models:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
  - Linear Regression (baseline)

### Hyperparameter Tuning

- Method: Bayesian Optimization
- Cross-validation: 5-fold
- Metrics:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - RÂ² Score

### Training Pipeline

```python
def train_pipeline():
    # Data loading
    data = load_data()
    
    # Preprocessing
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocess_data(data)
    
    # Model training
    model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Evaluation
    metrics = evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
    
    # Model registration
    register_model(model, metrics)
```

## MLflow Integration

## Model Serving

### Real-time Prediction

```python
def predict(features):
    # Load model
    model = load_model()
    
    # Preprocess features
    processed_features = preprocess_features(features)
    
    # Make prediction
    prediction = model.predict(processed_features)
    
    # Calculate confidence intervals
    confidence = calculate_confidence(model, processed_features)
    
    return prediction, confidence
```
